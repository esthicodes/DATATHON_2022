The quarantine does not apply generally or broadly (a) to some segment or all of a population, geographical area, building, or vessel (including without limitation shelter-in-place, stay-at-home, safer-at-home, or other similar restriction), or (b) based on to, from, or through where the person is traveling. This condition (ii) applies even if the quarantine order or directive specifically designates you or a traveling companion by name to be quarantined. Example 1: While you are on a cruise, the crew of your cruise ship is checking temperatures of all passengers and you or your traveling companion demonstrate a temperature outside the accepted range, causing you both to be ordered to quarantine while on board. This would qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine. Example 2: While you are on a cruise, the crew of your cruise ship is checking temperatures of all passengers. As a result of a passenger (not part of your traveling party) demonstrating a temperature outside the accepted range, all passengers on the ship are ordered to quarantine while on board. Because this quarantine applies generally or broadly to the population of the entire vessel, this would not qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine.

Example 4: You fly to a country that requires all persons entering the country to quarantine for fourteen days prior to being permitted to freely travel in the country.\u00a0 Because this is a general\/broad quarantine that applies based on the country to which you are traveling, this would not qualify as an individually-ordered quarantine.
